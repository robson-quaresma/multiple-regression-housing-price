# multiple-regression-housing-price
The objective of this repository is to try to practice some concepts learned at USP-Esalq related to multiple regression:
- Data exploration;
- Analyze whether there is at least one statistically significant beta among the independent variables (f test);
- If the f test returns that among all betas, there is at least one significant, evaluate which betas are statistically significant (t test);
- Evaluate whether the functional form of the model is correct for the significances indicated;
- Evaluate the adherence of the residues to normality;
- Apply, if necessary, normalization through the Box-Cox method;
- Evaluate whether there is multicollinearity;
- Evaluate whether there is Heteroscedasticity;
- Arrive at the best R2;
